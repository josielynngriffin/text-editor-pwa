# JATE Text Editor

## Description
This is a simple text editor. I began with frontend code that styled the application and gave the editor most of its function but configured it to work as a Progressive Web Application (PWA) with webpack, gave it a persistent database to save and reload a user's entries to the editor with the IndexedDB database, and made it installable! This project helped to familiarize myself with PWAs, deploying them to Heroku, and learning to run Heroku from a dev environment when my initial build failed!

### Languages and Technologies
JavaScript, Node.js, Express, Webpack, IndexedDB
